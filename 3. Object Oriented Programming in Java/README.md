>About this Course:
This is an intermediate Java course. We recommend this course to learners who have previous experience in software development or a background in computer science.  Our goal is that by the end of this course each and every one of you feels empowered to create a Java program that’s more advanced than any you have created in the past and that is personally interesting to you. In achieving this goal you will also learn the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming, how to leverage the power of existing libraries, how to build graphical user interfaces, and how to use some core algorithms for searching and sorting data. And this course is project-based, so we’ll dive right into the project immediately!

This course is provided by UCSD

After completing this course, you will be able to...

1. Author a class in Java and explain how objects are constructed, how they store data, and how you can define their actions.
2. Trace the execution of code using memory-models.
3. Define the scope of variables and methods.
4. Extend existing libraries to build a medium-sized project.
5. Implement user interface features.
6. Build and work with a class hierarchy that has multiple levels.
7. Explain “is-a” and “has-a” relationships between objects.
8. Author code which implements an Interface.
9. Explain the difference between compile-time and run-time decisions when working with polymorphism.
10. Explain the difference between event-driven programming and imperative programming.
11. Use searching and sorting to design algorithms for analyzing data.
12. Search for an element in a sorted and unsorted list and explain the differences.
13. Explain multiple sorting techniques and performance tradeoffs.

## Project Overview

Have you ever wondered how map overlays for Google Maps are created? In the project for this course you will build your own interactive visualization of a large dataset tagged by geospatial information. Both powerful and challenging, data visualization is one of the hot topics of modern computer science - as well as something that influences our world every day!

To create this project, you’ll be working with a package called Unfolding Maps, which is a library for interactive maps and geovisualizations. It was developed by Till Nagel and the team at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam along with other contributors and we are grateful that they developed such a cool package that we (and you) can build on for this course.

The project is separated into several parts, and you will be able to achieve project milestones as you work through the modules in the course. Throughout the project, we’ve suggested extensions and ideas for adding extra features to your project. Have fun with it and make it your own. At the end of the course, you’ll have the opportunity to showcase your creation and see what your peers have built too.

### Learning outcomes:
1. Build an interactive graphical program in Java
2. Design classes to make use of object-oriented programming paradigms
3. Explain inheritance and polymorphism and how each concept is applied in the creation of a Java GUI
4. Explain how event handling works in Java, and write event handlers to create an interactive program
5. Write and apply searching and sorting algorithms to manage large data sets
6. Find and fix errors (bugs) in code
7. Develop and use test cases to ensure correctness of a program
